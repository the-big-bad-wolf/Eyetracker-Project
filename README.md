## How to run

To activate the extension, press f5, or run the command "Debug: Start Debugging". If you need to develop the extension, you have to open a new window from the Typescript folder, and run the extension from this window.

After activation, in the window the extension is running in, press ctrl + shift + p in windows, cmd + shift + p on mac, type show data, and run this command. This should activate the statusbar and give a notification that the extension is calculating a baseline.

Run the websocket in the Python folder in order to have it actually show the cognitive load and trigger the notifiactions to toggle copilot. This requires the eyetracker.
