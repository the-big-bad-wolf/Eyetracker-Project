## How to run

To activate the extension, press f5 while being in a typescript file, or run the command "Debug: Start Debugging". If you need to develop the extension, you have to open a new window from the Typescript folder, and run the extension from this window.

After activation, in the window the extension is running in, press ctrl + shift + p in windows, cmd + shift + p on mac, type, then run, AI Initiated Help if you want to run with the system promting the user, or User Initiated Help if you want to run with a help button for the user to push to get help. This should activate the statusbar and give a notification that the extension is calculating a baseline.

Run main.py in the Python folder in order to have the extension actually show the cognitive load and trigger the notifications to toggle copilot. Receiving data requires the eyetracker.

## How to run tests

### Python tests

In the terminal, in the python folder, run the command python -m pytest

## How to install

Clone the repo, or otherwise download the extension-0.0.1.vsix file. In VSCode, go to the extension view, and click on the three dots in the right upper corner. Chose to install as vsix, and locate the vsix file on your computer. Alternatively, in the terminal, run the command

```
code--install-extension path\extension-0.0.1.vsix
```

where path is the path to where the vsix file is on your computer.

You still need to be running the backend in the same way as in the section above to get the data from the eye-tracker.

When the extension is installed, it works as any other extension, and you can run the commands from the section "How to run".
